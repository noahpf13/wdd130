    <h2>Hello!</h2>
    <p>My name is Noah. I’m a senior at BYU–Idaho about to graduate with a degree in Business Analytics and a minor in Data Science. I grew up in Virginia (so an East Coaster in my heart) but I have loved living in Idaho!</p>

    <h2>Why I’m Taking This Course</h2>
    <p>I am taking WDD 130 to get some foundation in web development and the idea of making my own website seems fun and challenging.</p>
