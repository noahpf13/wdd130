      <p><strong>Headline:</strong> Turn a Data Whirlwind Into a Clean Process</p>
      <p>
        Running a business shouldn’t mean wrestling with spreadsheets or sorting through scattered data. My goal is to help you turn that chaos into a simple, reliable system that supports better decisions. With clean data, automated workflows, and clear dashboards, you can finally focus on growing your business—not managing your files.
      </p>

      <p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 1 — Choose What You Need:</strong> Start by selecting the type of help you’re looking for. Whether it’s dashboards, data cleanup, or simple automation, you only need to describe the challenges you’re facing. I build the solution around your goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 2 — Connect With an Expert:</strong> You’ll meet with a specialist who understands small business operations and real-world data challenges. We talk through your workflow, what’s slowing you down, and what outcome would make your life easier. This conversation becomes the foundation for your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step 3 — Your Solution Delivered:</strong> I develop a clean, organized, and easy-to-use solution—whether that’s a dashboard, a standardized dataset, or an automated data pipeline. Everything is designed to save time, reduce errors, and give you clarity.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What Your Edge Will Be</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Get Your Data in Order:</strong> Messy data slows everything down. I’ll clean and organize it so your information is accurate and ready to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ease-of-Access Tools:</strong> Everything I build is simple, intuitive, and made for non-technical users.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A Smart Platform:</strong> Your data updates automatically, your reports refresh on schedule, and your decisions become faster and smarter.

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        I offer practical, results-focused data services built specifically for small and local businesses. Whether your data is messy or your reporting is time-consuming, these services help you streamline and simplify how you work.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Dashboarding &amp; KPI Reporting:</strong> Clear visuals help you understand your business faster. I design Power BI dashboards and KPI scorecards that track the numbers you care about most. With automated updates and clean layouts, your team always has an accurate view of performance—no manual reporting required.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Data Cleanup &amp; Standardization:</strong> If your data is inconsistent or scattered across multiple files, I’ll bring everything together into one dependable source of truth. I clean, standardize, deduplicate, and format your data so it stays accurate, reliable, and easy to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Automation &amp; Data Pipelines:</strong> Stop spending hours copying and pasting. I build simple automations and workflows that refresh on a schedule, pull in new files, and keep your data organized. These systems run quietly in the background and save you time every single week.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Custom Tools (Add-On):</strong> For unique business needs, I create lightweight tools—custom formulas, calculators, spreadsheet tools, or simple web apps. Everything is built to fit smoothly into your existing workflow without adding complexity.
      </p>
